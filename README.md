The retro game of pong developed using turtle graphics.


## Setup
Clone this repository to a local directory. Refer to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more guidance.

Next, you should install the package neccessary to run **main.py**: *turtle,* and *time*. You can install these using **pip**:
```
- pip install turtle
```
```
- pip install time
```

Now your setup is complete!

## Running the Code
To run the code, run **main.py**. This will open up the turtle window and display the pong graphics.

To control the left side paddle, use the "w" key to move up and "s" key to move down. Make sure to turn off Caps Lock beforehand.

To control the right side paddle, use the "up arrow" key to move up and "down arrow" key to move down.

That's all you need to know to play pong. Enjoy!
